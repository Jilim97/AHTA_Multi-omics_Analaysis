## Key Objectives
- Understanding lung cancer at a molecular level using multi-omics data.
- Identifying statistically significant genes in lung cancer.

## Data Sources
- Public datasets including Microarray, Infinium, RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq.

## Methodology
### 1. Microarray Analysis
   - Utilized for analyzing the transcriptomic aspect of lung carcinoma, focusing on differentially expressed genes.

### 2. RNA-seq Analysis
   - Employed to analyze transcriptomic data, highlighting differences in gene expression between cancerous and normal tissues.

### 3. Methylation Profiling
   - Used for the epigenomic analysis of lung carcinoma tissues, targeting methylation patterns in cancer-related genes.

### 4. ChIP-seq Analysis
   - Applied to study epigenetic modifications and understand treatment impact on lung cancer gene expression.
